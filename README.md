# 🌙 Isle of the Riddle Second

## 🎨 Concept

This scene continues the “Isle of the Riddle” journey with a shift in atmosphere. Where the first isle was bright and welcoming, this one takes place on a moonlit beach at dusk, where ancient ruins rise from the sand. The goal is to deepen the mystery and challenge, while keeping the visual style engaging and cohesive with the overall adventure.

## 🌌 Visual Style

* **Background:** A beach at dusk/night, with ruins half-buried in the sand.
* **Palette:** Dark blues, purples, and moonlight silver, contrasted with warm torch glows.
* **Atmosphere:** Quiet, slightly eerie, with an emphasis on exploration and discovery.
* **Presentation:** Text and puzzles are displayed on semi-transparent stone-like panels, evoking carved tablets within the ruins.

## 🧩 Structure

1. **Intro Widget** – Sets the stage: the traveler arrives at the ruins, sensing their history and weight.
2. **Lore Widget** – Provides backstory about the isle, forgotten rulers, and whispers that the ruins hide more than riddles.
3. **Runic Puzzle Challenge** –  
   * The trial of this isle is represented as a magical tablet.  
   * Four runes must be clicked in the correct ascending order to activate the teleporter.  
   * Equations etched nearby reinforce the significance of the number **40**, guiding the solution.  
   * Feedback glows on success or failure, with optional progressive hints to aid players after repeated mistakes.  
4. **Exploration Element** – The scene encourages players to look around carefully. Not everything is immediately obvious.

## ⚙️ Technical Notes

* Built with **HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript** for interactivity.
* Rune interactions are handled with JavaScript for sequence validation and feedback.
* Styling emphasizes stone tablet panels, glowing runes, and smooth hover/fade-in effects.
* Responsive design ensures the scene works across different screen sizes.

## ✨ Special Note

This scene contains a small hidden detail for explorers who take time to interact with the environment. It won’t affect progression but adds extra flavor for curious players.
