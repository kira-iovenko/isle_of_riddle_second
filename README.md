# üåô Isle of the Riddle Second

## Concept

This scene continues the ‚ÄúIsle of the Riddle‚Äù journey with a shift in atmosphere. Where the first isle was bright and welcoming, this one takes place on a moonlit beach at dusk, where ancient ruins rise from the sand. The goal is to deepen the mystery and challenge, while keeping the visual style engaging and cohesive with the overall adventure.

## Visual Style

* **Background:** A beach at dusk/night, with ruins half-buried in the sand.
* **Palette:** Dark blues, purples, and moonlight silver, contrasted with warm torch glows.
* **Atmosphere:** Quiet, slightly eerie, with an emphasis on exploration and discovery.

## Structure

1. **Intro Widget** ‚Äì Sets the stage: the traveler arrives at the ruins, sensing their history and weight.
2. **Lore Widget** ‚Äì Provides backstory about the isle, forgotten rulers, and whispers that the ruins hide more than riddles.
3. **Riddle Challenge** ‚Äì

   * Includes more challenging riddles than the first isle.
   * Players must solve all riddles to reveal the button that leads to *Isle of the Riddle Third*.
4. **Exploration Element** ‚Äì The scene encourages players to look around carefully. Not everything is immediately obvious.

## Technical Notes

* Built with **HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript** for interactivity.
* Interactive riddles will use input fields and validation.
* Styling will include hover effects, fade-ins, etc.
* The design will be responsive so it works on different screen sizes.

## Special Note

This scene contains a small hidden detail for explorers who take time to interact with the environment. It won‚Äôt affect progression but adds extra flavor for curious players.
