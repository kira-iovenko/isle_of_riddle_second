# 🌙 Isle of the Riddle Second

## 🎨 Concept

This is the finalized submission for **Scene 40** of the *Grand Survey Expedition* challenge on [summer.hackclub.com](https://summer.hackclub.com).  

The scene continues the "Isle of the Riddle" journey with a shift in atmosphere. Where the first isle was bright and welcoming, this one takes place on a moonlit beach at dusk, where ancient ruins rise from the sand. The goal is to deepen the mystery and challenge, while keeping the visual style engaging and cohesive with the overall adventure.

## 🌌 Visual Style

* **Background:** A beach at dusk/night, with ruins half-buried in the sand.
* **Palette:** Dark blues, purples, and moonlight silver, contrasted with warm torch glows.
* **Atmosphere:** Quiet, slightly eerie, with an emphasis on exploration and discovery.
* **Presentation:** Text and puzzles are displayed on semi-transparent stone-like panels, evoking carved tablets within the ruins.

## 🧩 Structure

The main flow of the scene is straightforward:  
1. **Intro & Lore** – The traveler arrives at the ruins and senses their weight.  
2. **Runic Puzzle Challenge** – Four runes must be clicked in the correct ascending order to activate the teleport.  
   * Inscriptions etched nearby reinforce the number **40**, guiding the solution.  
   * Feedback glows on success or failure, with progressive hints after repeated mistakes.  
3. **Teleport** – Once solved, the teleport awakens and carries the traveler to the next isle.  

Beyond this main path, the isle also rewards curiosity. Careful explorers may notice hidden details that unlock additional layers of the scene, including a secret chamber and a playful easter egg. These discoveries don't block progression but add depth for those who look closer.

## ⚙️ Technical Notes

* Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for interactivity.
* Rune puzzle logic handles sequence validation, feedback, and progressive hints.
* Overlays use pixel-precise hover detection for natural interactions.
* Widgets are styled as glowing stone tablets for thematic consistency.
* Responsive design ensures the scene works across different screen sizes.

## ✨ Special Note

The scene is designed with both a clear path forward and optional secrets. Players can progress smoothly by following the main flow, but explorers who linger may uncover more than expected.

## 🛠️ Behind the Curtain

Even the isle needed a little help taking shape:  
* **ChatGPT** – whispered ideas for code and conjured image prompts  
* **Paint.NET** – carved images into separate layers  
* **Squoosh.app** – compressed the art into light, fast-loading WebP forms
